            <b>About me:</b> Born in France, I have always had a keen interest
            in design and new technologies. My academic studies and work
            experiences have played a pivotal role in developing both my
            creativity and technical skills. Additionally, I am deeply
            passionate about travel and exploration, and I've had the privilege
            to work in countries boasting rich cultures and stunning landscapes,
            which have been a tremendous source of inspiration in my daily life.
            <br />
            <p>
              Currently, I am an Australian citizen residing in the Brisbane
              area. With a strong background in development and a sharp eye for
              design, I thoroughly enjoy taking on multiple tasks and am always
              eager to embrace new challenges. At this moment, my preferred
              technologies include VueJS and ReactJS.
